# Checksum is useless

in dap you can specify a checksum for a source.

There doesn't seem to be a raison for a adaptor to provide one.

It is not a unique identifier (tow source can have the same content while still being deferent source)

There are no request or event that refer to a source by there checksum, or take the checksum as a parameter.
